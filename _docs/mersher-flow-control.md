- Flow control avoids microservice overload operations by controlling the data transfer rate. This guide will show you how to use the flow control capabilities provided by **mersher**

# Before you start

- Walk through [mersher-quick-start](/docs/mersher-quick-start/) and have **mersher display programs** running.

# Enable

- Change the configuration file **chassis.yaml** of **mersher_calculator**. Add a flow control configuration in **chassis.yaml** as follows. Restart the service.

  ```yaml
  flowcontrol:
   Provider:
     qps:
       enabled: true                 # enable rate limiting or not
       global:
         limit: 0                    # default limit of provider
       limit:
         Server: 0                  # rate limit for request from a provider
  ```

  The frequency limit configuration make the request accepted per second is 0 which means no service is provided.

# Verification

- Click the _Submit_ button and you can see that the request was rejected due to the flow control of mersher. Now the request can not reach real httpserver.
